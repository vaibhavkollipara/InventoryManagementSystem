# InventoryManagementSystem
Inventory Management System for tracking within physical, single site warehouses(Project to demonstrate multi-threading in java).

<h3>Description</h3>
IMS will be responsible for the inventory tracking within physical, single site warehouses. IMS will track the named physical location of a product within the warehouse and the inventory level of each product. IMS will be deployed to busy warehouses supporting many pickers and restockers working with individual terminals and clients. Updates to inventory levels will be handled in real time to prevent pickers trying to pick a product that is out of stock.

<h4>Assumptions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Each product will be stored at one and only one named location within the warehouse.</li>
  <li>Inventory adjustments may be additive (restocks) or subtractive (picks).</li>
  <li>No additional product information needs to be tracked beyond location and level.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Project Developement Environment Details</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Operaitng System : Windows 10</li>
  <li>Programming Language : Java</li>
  <li>IDE : Eclipse</li>
</ul>
